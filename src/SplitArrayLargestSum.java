    //For example arr={2,3,4,5,6,7,9,0} partition1={2,3,4} partition2={5,6,7,9,0} so the max partition sum  is partition 2 which is 5+6+7+9+0 which is 27 so the we have to make partiition like that and find the parttion which is maximum but have to minimum when we ccomparte it with all the partitions
